# P5-Percolation
This was a project done for my CS201 class. The goal was to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via a Monte Carlo simulation. To do this, I simulated a NxN grid where you could randomly open sites at various points in the grid. If there was a path from the bottom to the top of the grid, then the system percolates. I used both Union Find and Depth First Search algorithims in this code to search the grid and determine whether or not the system percolates.
